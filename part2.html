        <h1> WHO WE ARE </h1> 
        <P> We are a collective of architects, designers, engineers and planners working together to build a better future
            Our firm, Stairs Architecture, is responsible for some of the worlds most technically and environmentally advanced
            buildings and significant public spaces. Our approach is highly collaborative, and our interdisciplinary team is 
            internationl. Working from a network of creative studios across the globe, we are able to apply international 
            expertise at a local level. </P>

        <h2> How We Work </h2>  
        <p> We believe that design is about more than meeting people's needs-it is the art of realizing their aspirations and 
            changing the way they experience the world. The best results come from a balance of disciplines: planning, interiors, 
            engineering, and architecture. This total design approach means seamless coordination, from the dynamic initial
            design stages to the pride in seeing users inspired by the end result. </p>
